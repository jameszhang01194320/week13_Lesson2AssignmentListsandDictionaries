Lesson 2: Assignment | Lists and Dictionaries
________________________________________
Advanced Operations on Python Lists
Objective: Understand Python lists by exploring more complex operations, such as list comprehension, slicing, and sorting, and analyzing their time and space complexities.
Problem Statement: Delve deeper into Python lists and master advanced operations. Implement various complex tasks using lists and analyze their efficiency in terms of time and space complexities.
Task 1
•	Implement a function to create a new list using list comprehension that contains squares of numbers from 1 to n, where n is a parameter. Analyze the time and space complexity of this operation.
Task 2
•	Implement a function to merge two pre-sorted lists into a single sorted list. Analyze the time complexity of this operation.
Expected Outcomes:
•	Students should demonstrate proficiency in using advanced list operations such as list comprehension, slicing, and sorting.
•	Students should be able to analyze the time and space complexities of complex list operations and understand their performance implications.
•	Students should develop problem-solving skills by tackling more complex tasks using Python lists.

Dictionary Manipulation and Optimization
Objective: Understand Python dictionaries by exploring advanced manipulation techniques and optimization strategies.
Problem Statement: Explore advanced manipulation techniques and optimization strategies for Python dictionaries. Implement various dictionary operations and optimize them for improved performance.
dict_1 = {
'pie': 'apple',
'ice_cream': 'moose tracks',
'cobbler': 'peach',
'cake': None
}

dict_2 = {
'dinner': 'turkey',
'ice_cream': 'vanilla',
'appetizer': 'soup',
'cobbler': 'peach'
}
Task 1
•	Implement a function to merge two dictionaries, preserving the values of common keys from the second dictionary. Analyze the time complexity of this operation.
merged = {
'pie': 'apple',
'ice_cream': 'vanilla',
'cobbler': 'peach',
'cake': None,
'dinner': 'turkey,
'appetizer': 'soup'
}
Task 2
•	Implement a function to find the intersection of two dictionaries, i.e., keys common to both dictionaries along with their values. Analyze the time complexity of this operation.
intersection = {
'cobbler': 'peach'
}
Expected Outcomes:
•	Students should demonstrate proficiency in using advanced dictionary manipulation techniques and optimization strategies.
•	Students should be able to analyze the time and space complexities of complex dictionary operations and understand their performance implications.
•	Students should develop optimization skills by implementing efficient algorithms for dictionary manipulation.
